# Udemy Courses Analysis Final Project

## Introduction

This is the introduction to my final project on analyzing the courses offered in Udemy.

## Data Dictionary

| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| course_title | Name of the course |
| is_paid | Whether the course is paid or unpaid |
| price | Cost of the course |
| num_subscribers | Number of subscribers |
| num_lectures | Number of lectures each course contains |
| level | Difficulty level |
| content_duration | Duration of the course (in hours) |
| subject | Subjects that the courses belong to |

To begin with, I will be analyzing the data that contains information about courses offered in Udemy. I have produced actionable strategies that will benefit users, lecturers and Udemy themselves by wrangling and mining data. 

In order to improve the customer experience, a recommender model is built to show users the top rated courses based on their input.

Tech used: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Wordcloud, Matplotlib.
